# Toolchain Review

Use for validators, import/normalization scripts, canonical builds, SQLite,
generated artifacts, and CI.

Check:

- canonical source remains authoritative;
- generated output comes only from canonical/build inputs;
- generated artifacts are not hand-edited;
- canonical → generated data remains faithful;
- required builds are logically deterministic;
- required schema/index/metadata behavior is preserved.

Mechanical checks belong in scripts/CI, including schema validity, references,
duplicates, invalid relations, generated-data fidelity, DB structure, and
package contents.

When a validator, fixture, expected result, or CI workflow changes, verify that
the check itself is still valid.

Validator changes must include evidence that known-invalid input fails and
valid input passes.

Otherwise, a passing deterministic check is sufficient evidence for the
property it covers.

For lexical validators and regression tests:

- prefer repository-wide invariants over batch-, record-, or word-specific
  checks;
- verify that general rules run against all applicable existing canonical data;
- verify that future lexical additions reach the same rule through the common
  validation/admission path;
- allow batch-specific checks only for genuinely batch-specific constraints;
- reject fixtures that merely memorize affected canonical records when a small
  synthetic fixture can prove the general rule.

## Canonical and CI architecture changes

When these paths change, verify the complete canonical revision feeds a shared
in-process context; global semantic audit precedes SQLite build; downstream
checks consume the same artifact; current-canonical gates and isolated tests
do not repeatedly parse, scan, build, or transport the entire context.
Check reported parse/full-scan/index/build counts against actual runner wiring.
Changed-only validation may give early feedback, not final coverage.

CI levels must remain nested: `ci:fast` (early), `ci:normal` (merge coverage),
`ci:all` (deep/manual or scheduled, including scale). A PR may expose fast
then continue normal **within one process/session**, not duplicate fresh
full-canonical work. Independent two-build reproducibility is deep/manual,
not a redundant normal gate. If Deep CI or a Deep regression changes, require
a successful **`Deep CI Gate` on this exact HEAD** (`deep-ci` runs `ci:all`);
ordinary PRs can use the passing skip gate.
